## Commitizen

[Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) is used to ensure a good commit semantic release messages and in order to automatically generate a CHANGELOG. In order to use this tool a npm script is available. Fortunatelly if you don't know what I'm talking about it's not a problem 'cause everything is neatly configured to run smoothly and automagically ;)
